# SurveyOfMachineLearningAlgorithms
Machine Learning Project for Spring 2015 at UIC

The project was aimed at comparing accuracy scores for different algorithms (k-NN, decision trees and random forests, Support Vector Machines and neural networks) for a complex dataset. 

Dataset: Otto group dataset from Kaggle, containing 9 classes with 93 features and about 200,000 labelled items given.
The dataset was not only multi-class, and complex, but was also skewed. 

The project was implemented in Matlab.
